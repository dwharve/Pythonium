### Quick Start

```python
from pythonium.core.managers import get_manager_registry
from pythonium.managers import DevTeamManager

# Register the DevTeam manager
registry = get_manager_registry()
registry.register_manager("devteam", DevTeamManager, auto_start=True)

# Start all managers
await registry.start_all_managers()

# Submit a development task
await event_manager.publish("devteam.task.submit", {
    "task_id": "feature-001",
    "task_type": "feature",
    "title": "User Authentication",
    "description": "Implement JWT-based authentication",
    "submitter": "api_client",
    "priority": "high"
})

```python
from pythonium.tools.std.devteam import DevTeamTaskSubmissionTool

# Submit a task via tool
result = await devteam_submit_task(
