# DevTeam Manager

## Overview

The DevTeam Manager is a sophisticated management system that utilizes LangGraph to orchestrate a series of AI agents working together as a complete software development team. This manager exposes object-oriented systems to tools, allowing them to submit development tasks and receive progress updates through the event bus.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Manager Infrastructure
- **Base Class**: Extends `BaseManager` for lifecycle management and event integration
- **Threading**: Runs in its own thread as per manager framework design
- **Communication**: Uses the Pythonium event bus for all external communication
- **Health Monitoring**: Includes built-in health checks and metrics

#### 2. Agent Framework
- **Orchestration**: LangGraph-based workflow management
- **Agent Types**: Specialized agents for different development roles
- **Task Distribution**: Intelligent task routing and assignment
- **Collaboration**: Inter-agent communication and dependency management

#### 3. Event-Driven Interface
- **Task Submission**: Tools submit tasks via event bus
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time progress notifications
- **Status Reporting**: Detailed status and error reporting
- **Result Delivery**: Completed work delivered via events

## Usage Examples

### Basic Task Submission
```python
# Tool submitting a development task
await event_manager.publish("devteam.task.submit", {
    "task_id": "feature-123",
    "task_type": "feature",
    "description": "Implement user authentication system",
    "requirements": [
        "JWT token-based authentication",
        "Password reset functionality",
        "Multi-factor authentication support"
    ],
    "priority": 4,
    "submitter": "api_tool"
})
```

### Progress Monitoring
```python
# Tool subscribing to progress updates
def handle_progress(event):
    data = event.data
    print(f"Task {data['task_id']}: {data['percentage_complete']}% complete")
    print(f"Current phase: {data['phase']}")
    print(f"Current agent: {data['current_agent']}")

event_manager.subscribe("devteam.progress.*", handle_progress)
```

### Task Completion Handling
```python
# Tool handling task completion
def handle_completion(event):
    data = event.data
    task_id = data['task_id']
    results = data['results']
    
    print(f"Task {task_id} completed successfully!")
    print(f"Deliverables: {results['deliverables']}")
    print(f"Documentation: {results['documentation_urls']}")

event_manager.subscribe("devteam.task.completed", handle_completion)
```
